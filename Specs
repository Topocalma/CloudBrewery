This project should be alive and the design improve over time as experience and ideas flow back into it.  There is an enormous amount of know how out there already – lets draw  on it, no need to re-invent the wheel.  However I am sure we can come up with or assemble a lot of clever ideas that will make our brewery even better.  

Specifications  
• Built from ‘standard’ parts (i.e. parts and materials with a high probability of availability on different countries and continents)
•	‘Adaptability’ to an increasingly sophisticated home brewer’s requirements.  ‘Modular’ design allows maximum reusing of part when upgrading the system
•	Focus on  process control
•	Cost efficiency
•	Suitable for ales and lagers
•	Ease of cleaning
•	Ease of built (tools and know how that is required)
•	Safety
•	Look
•	Capacity 5 gallon/20 liter or 10 gallon/50 liter
•	Secondary: 15 gallon/60liter design
•	Secondary: Compact design
•	Secondary: Energy efficiency
•	Metric system (prio)

Deliverables: 
•	Specifications (by stage) 
•	Sketches 
•	Drawings including measurements (where necessary)
•	List of materials 
•	Sources for parts (generic and specific)
•	Costing 
•	Assembly instructions
•	Pictures illustration
•	Tips and tricks
•	Examples
